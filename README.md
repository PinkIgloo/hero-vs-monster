## Observations & What I Learned

- Refactored code for better modularity and bug tracking
- Learned the importance of console logging and tiny incremental testing
- Learned how to connect JavaScript with HTML elements using event listeners
- Learned how to toggle and disable buttons to prevent chaos and undead heroes
- Game now updates in real time based on player choices
- Discovered and debugged a humorous recursive death bug ðŸ« 

## Future Plans / Improvements

- cleanup and update CSS (set panel size)
- Implement ticking status effects over multiple turns (e.g., ongoing burn damage)
- Add animations and sound effects
- Scaled difficulty that leads to a boss battle
- Reward system with consumables for health, mana, resistence, coins
- Small inventory (4 slots per character)
